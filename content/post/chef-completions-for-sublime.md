Today I release my Sublime Text Package for authoring Chef [Cookbooks](https://docs.chef.io/resources.html) and [InSpec](https://docs.chef.io/inspec_reference.html) files.
<!--more-->
This package is based on [SublimeChef](https://github.com/brianhays/SublimeChef), but has been updated to Chef v12.x Cookbook resources and extended to support Chef InSpec.

### Install

You can install this package by entering the Packages directory of Sublime Text (on OSX this would normally be `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/`) and issuing on a terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/mschygulla/SublimeChefDK
